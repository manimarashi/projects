Thanks for checking out my codes.

By defaut the game only trains for 1 million games. Which took around 15-20mins on my laptop. So be patient a bit for it to finish running. You can increase this number to train the model further.

The output file is around 600MBs for 1 million games. This only and roughly captures around 2% of all possible moves.
